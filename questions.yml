  - category: "Lambda"
    prompt: "What is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous lambda invocation?"
    choices: 
      - "Synchronous invocation ensures that all consumers of the lambda function will receive the same results"
      - "Synchronous invocation waits for lambda to process the event and return a response, whereas asynchronous invocation queues the work but returns a response immediately"
      - "Asynchronous invocation is less expensive and more reliable"

    prompt: "In the context of Lambda, what is a trigger?"
    choices: 
      - "A trigger is a special condition you specify when creating your lambda that determines which inputs the function will accept"
      - "A trigger is a Lambda resource or a resource in another service that you configure to invoke your function in response to lifecycle events, external requests, or on a schedule"
      - "A trigger is a safety feature that allows you to quickly stop a lambda function from processing. It can be used to prevent your lambda from operating on unsafe data"

    prompt: "If a lambda has multiple triggers configured, what is true of every event object sent to the function?"
    choices: 
      - "The event may or may not contain data from multiple sources or triggers"
      - "The event will contain data from the most recent invoker of the function"
      - "Each event will only ever contain data from a single client or trigger, because each invocation is independent, even when multiple clients or triggers are configured"
